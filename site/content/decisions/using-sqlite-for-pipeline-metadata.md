rationale: "The AI-assisted content curation pipeline requires a persistent storage mechanism to track processed articles (to avoid re-processing) and source fetch timestamps (to manage polling). The decision to use SQLite was based on:
1.  **Robustness & Data Integrity:** SQLite provides a structured, ACID-compliant database solution, ensuring data consistency and reliability, which is superior to simple file-based JSON storage.
2.  **Simplicity & Lightweight:** As an embedded, file-based database, SQLite requires no separate server process, keeping the pipeline component lightweight and easy to manage within the monorepo. This avoids the operational overhead of a full-fledged database.
3.  **Performance & Scalability:** For the anticipated volume of metadata (tens of thousands of article entries), SQLite offers excellent performance and remains efficient, with a small file footprint (unlikely to exceed low double-digit MBs).
4.  **Querying Capabilities:** Supports SQL queries, allowing for more flexible and powerful data retrieval and management as the pipeline evolves.

While a simple JSON file was considered for its ease of implementation, SQLite was chosen for its enhanced robustness and simplicity. Full-fledged or cloud-based databases were deemed overkill for the current scope."
impact: "The `pipeline/` component will include a SQLite database file to manage its state. This requires using Python's `sqlite3` module (or an ORM) within the pipeline's code. The database file will be part of the monorepo, and its management (e.g., schema migrations) will need to be handled within the pipeline's development lifecycle."

## Context

The AI-assisted content curation pipeline requires a method to persistently store metadata such as source URLs, last fetch timestamps, and a record of processed article URLs. This is crucial to prevent re-processing content and to manage the pipeline's state effectively.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **JSON File:** A simple file-based approach for storing data in JSON format.
*   **Full-fledged Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):** A client-server database system.
*   **Cloud-based Key-Value Store (e.g., AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud Firestore):** A managed, serverless database service.

## Decision

**SQLite** was chosen for persistent storage of the pipeline's metadata.

## Rationale

The selection of SQLite was driven by:

*   **Balance of Robustness and Simplicity:** It offers the benefits of a relational database (data integrity, SQL querying) without the operational overhead of a separate server.
*   **Lightweight and Embedded:** The database is a single file within the `pipeline/` directory, making it easy to manage within the monorepo.
*   **Performance:** Efficient for the expected volume of metadata.
*   **Querying Capabilities:** Supports SQL queries, allowing for more flexible and powerful data retrieval and management.

## Implications & Future Considerations

The `pipeline/` component will utilize Python's `sqlite3` module to interact with the database. The SQLite database file will be part of the monorepo. Future considerations include defining the database schema and managing schema migrations as the pipeline's data requirements evolve.
