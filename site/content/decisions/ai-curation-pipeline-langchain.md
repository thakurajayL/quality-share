rationale: "The core mission of 'Quality Share' is to provide a curated platform of high-quality technical content. To scale this curation process efficiently while maintaining quality, an AI-assisted pipeline was deemed essential. The decision to implement this pipeline using LangChain for orchestration was based on:
1.  **Scalability & Efficiency:** Automating the initial discovery, fetching, and ranking of potential content significantly reduces manual effort.
2.  **Quality Maintenance:** The pipeline acts as a filter, presenting only high-potential content for human review, thus upholding the 'Quality is Everything' philosophy.
3.  **Intelligent Orchestration:** LangChain provides a robust framework for chaining LLM calls, integrating external tools, and building modular 'agents' within the pipeline (e.g., Fetcher, Ranker, Summarizer, PR Generator). This addresses the need for dynamic decision-making and intelligence beyond simple serial execution.
4.  **Flexibility & Extensibility:** LangChain's abstraction layer allows for easier swapping of underlying LLM providers and integration of new tools or algorithms in the future.
5.  **Skill Showcase:** Demonstrating the ability to design and implement an intelligent AI pipeline using modern frameworks like LangChain is a significant skill showcase."
impact: "The AI pipeline will reside in a dedicated `pipeline/` directory within the monorepo. It will be orchestrated by GitHub Actions, triggering containerized processes. Key considerations include robust handling of external API rate limits and secure management of API keys using GitHub Secrets. The pipeline will be implemented in Python, leveraging the curator's multi-language proficiency. Initial risks related to AI accuracy and bias will be mitigated by starting small and iteratively refining the logic."

## Context

To fulfill the project's mission of providing a curated platform of high-quality technical content, a scalable and efficient content discovery and summarization mechanism was required. The goal was to leverage AI to assist the human curator, not replace them.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Purely Manual Curation:** Relying solely on manual discovery and summarization, which would be time-consuming and limit scalability.
*   **Simple LLM Request/Response Scripts:** Using basic scripts to interact with LLMs, which would lack the orchestration, modularity, and advanced agentic capabilities offered by a framework.

## Decision

An **AI-assisted Content Curation Pipeline** will be implemented, with **LangChain** chosen as the orchestration framework.

## Rationale

The decision was driven by:

*   **Automation and Scale:** To efficiently process a large volume of potential content.
*   **Quality Control:** To pre-filter content, ensuring human curators focus on high-potential articles.
*   **Intelligent Workflow:** LangChain enables the creation of modular, intelligent components (agents) for fetching, ranking, and summarizing, allowing for dynamic decision-making within the pipeline.
*   **Flexibility:** LangChain's abstraction facilitates swapping LLM providers and integrating new tools.
*   **Skill Showcase:** Demonstrating advanced AI/ML pipeline design and implementation.

## Implications & Future Considerations

The pipeline will be housed in a dedicated `pipeline/` directory within the monorepo and orchestrated by GitHub Actions. It will be implemented in Python. Critical aspects include implementing robust API rate limit handling (retries, backoff) and secure API key management using GitHub Secrets. The initial AI accuracy and bias risks will be managed through iterative refinement.
