rationale: "Hugo was selected as the Static Site Generator (SSG) for the 'Quality Share' project after evaluating several alternatives. The primary drivers for this decision were:
1.  **Curator's Go Background:** The curator's proficiency in Go (the language Hugo is built with) was a significant factor, enabling deeper understanding, easier debugging, and potential future contributions or extensions.
2.  **Performance:** Hugo is renowned for its exceptional build speed and the resulting highly performant static websites, which aligns with the project's goal of delivering a fast and responsive user experience.
3.  **Skill Showcase:** Utilizing a modern, high-performance SSG like Hugo effectively showcases contemporary web development skills to potential employers and collaborators.
4.  **Scalability:** Hugo's efficiency makes it well-suited for handling a growing number of curated articles without significant performance degradation during the build process.

While Jekyll offered simpler native integration with GitHub Pages, Hugo's advantages in performance and alignment with the curator's existing skill set were prioritized. Next.js was considered for its React ecosystem but was deemed less aligned with the curator's Go background for this specific project."
impact: "The choice of Hugo necessitates the use of GitHub Actions for automated deployment to GitHub Pages, as Hugo is not natively built by GitHub Pages like Jekyll. This adds a layer of CI/CD complexity but also provides an opportunity to showcase automation skills. The theme customization will require Go templating knowledge, a risk mitigated by leveraging AI for code generation."

## Context

The initial phase of the 'Quality Share' project required the selection of a Static Site Generator (SSG) to build the website. The primary goals were to create a highly performant, maintainable, and scalable platform for curated technical content, while also serving as a showcase for the project creator's technical skills.

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Jekyll:** A Ruby-based SSG with native support on GitHub Pages, offering simplicity and ease of initial deployment.
*   **Next.js (Static Export):** A React-based framework capable of generating static sites, offering a powerful JavaScript ecosystem and component-based development.

## Decision

**Hugo** was selected as the Static Site Generator.

## Rationale

The decision to use Hugo was driven by a combination of technical advantages and alignment with the project creator's objectives:

*   **Performance:** Hugo's build times are exceptionally fast, leading to a highly performant end-user experience.
*   **Leveraging Existing Skills:** The project creator's background in Go provided a strong foundation for understanding and potentially extending Hugo, which is written in Go. This also serves as a valuable skill showcase.
*   **Modern Tooling:** Hugo represents a modern approach to static site generation, demonstrating proficiency with current web development practices.
*   **Scalability for Content:** Its efficiency ensures that even with a large volume of curated articles, the site build process remains quick and manageable.

## Implications & Future Considerations

The selection of Hugo requires a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment to GitHub Pages, as opposed to Jekyll's native support. This was accepted as it provides an opportunity to demonstrate CI/CD automation skills. The theme customization will require Go templating knowledge, a risk mitigated by leveraging AI for code generation.
