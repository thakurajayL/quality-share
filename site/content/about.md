## Our Mission

Quality Share aims to be your trusted librarian for high-quality technical content, especially for professionals interested in distributed systems. In a world of information overload, we provide a curated selection of the best technical articles from top companies and experts, complete with concise summaries and key takeaways to accelerate learning and discovery.

## Our Philosophy: Quality is Everything

We prioritize exceptional quality over a consistent publishing schedule. Content is only shared when it meets an exceptionally high standard. Our goal is to help software architects and senior engineers stay current with real-world, in-depth technical solutions without the noise.

## How It Works

Our platform uses an AI-assisted, human-in-the-loop curation pipeline:

1.  **AI Discovery:** An AI pipeline automatically discovers and processes potential articles from various engineering blogs and research journals.
2.  **Human Curation:** A human librarian (you!) reviews, refines, and approves each article via a transparent Pull Request workflow.
3.  **Static Site Generation:** Approved content is then published to this static website, ensuring fast, secure, and reliable access.

## Why Quality Share?

We address the pain points of information overload and time-consuming discovery by:

*   **Delivering High Signal:** By being extremely selective, we cut through the noise.
*   **Adding Human Insight:** Our summaries and takeaways provide a layer of human analysis that generic aggregators lack.
*   **Focusing on Real-World Solutions:** We highlight how leading companies solve complex engineering problems.

## Technical Approach

This project is built on a modern, open-source stack:

*   **Hugo:** For fast and secure static site generation.
*   **Python & LangChain:** Powering the AI-assisted content curation pipeline.
*   **GitHub Actions:** Automating our CI/CD and content review workflow.
*   **SQLite:** For efficient local data storage.

We believe in transparency and continuous learning. This project itself is open-source, and its architecture is designed to be an educational showcase of modern web development and AI integration.
