summary: "Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) is Meta's advanced network fabric technology designed for AI training networks, overcoming challenges of existing networks. DSF breaks the physical limit of traditional architectures by disaggregating components, offering scalability and performance. DSF utilizes a two-domain architecture with interface nodes (INs) and fabric nodes (FNs) for efficient traffic management. DSF achieves near-optimal load balancing and fine-grained traffic management through packet spraying and credit-based congestion control. DSF has been implemented to build large AI clusters, connecting thousands of GPUs within data center regions. The technology is evolving to create mega clusters across regions and introduce Hyperports to enhance network performance."
