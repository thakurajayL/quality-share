summary: "The text discusses Meta's Design for Sustainability principles for IT hardware, focusing on reducing emissions and costs through reuse, extended hardware lifecycles, and greener materials. Strategies include modularity, retrofitting, dematerialization, and using green steel. The company aims to reach net zero emissions by 2030 by optimizing hardware design, collaborating with suppliers, and reducing Scope 3 emissions. Key actions involve extending hardware life, reducing raw material use, and adopting low carbon technologies. Collaboration with suppliers and ongoing sustainability efforts are crucial for achieving sustainability goals and driving operational efficiency."
