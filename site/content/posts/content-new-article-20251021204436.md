summary: "The text discusses Meta's Design for Sustainability principles for IT hardware, focusing on reducing emissions and costs through reuse, extended hardware lifecycles, and greener materials. Strategies include modular design, retrofitting, dematerialization, and using green steel and recycled materials. The company aims to reach net zero emissions by 2030 by optimizing hardware design, collaborating with suppliers, and reducing Scope 3 emissions. The focus is on reducing environmental impact, lowering costs, and promoting sustainability across the value chain."
