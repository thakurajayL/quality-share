summary: "Meta is focusing on achieving net zero emissions by 2030 and is developing a methodology to estimate and track the carbon emissions of IT hardware components in data centers. This involves using AI to improve understanding of Scope 3 emissions and create a common taxonomy for the industry. The goal is to drive sustainable manufacturing practices and reduce emissions by collaborating with suppliers and enhancing data accuracy. The methodology includes leveraging AI for identifying similar components, extracting data from diverse sources, and categorizing components for a detailed breakdown of emissions. The approach aims to enhance data quality, consistency, and traceability to support sustainability efforts. The company plans to open source the methodology and taxonomy to drive industry-wide adoption of sustainable practices."
