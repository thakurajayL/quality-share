summary: StyleX is Meta's styling system that combines the benefits of CSS-in-JS with the performance of static CSS. It generates atomic CSS, enforces constraints for predictability and scalability, and discourages global styling in favor of localized classnames. The system allows for the creation and manipulation of design tokens, supports animations and media queries, and is maintained by a team of CSS enthusiasts. Future plans include support for shareable functions, inline styles, and bundler integrations.
