summary: "Meta is sharing details at the Open Compute Project Summit about next-generation network fabrics for AI training clusters. They are expanding their network hardware portfolio and contributing new disaggregated network platforms to OCP. Meta believes open hardware is crucial for innovation in data center infrastructure supporting AI technologies. They have introduced new milestones for data center networking, including the evolution of Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF) and a new Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF) architecture. Meta is also introducing new OCP switch platforms and optics solutions. They are actively involved in the Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking (ESUN) initiative within OCP to advance Ethernet technology for high-performance AI systems. Meta invites industry partners to collaborate in shaping the future of networking hardware for AI."
