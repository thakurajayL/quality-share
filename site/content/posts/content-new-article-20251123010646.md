summary: Instagram for iOS has introduced Dolby Vision and ambient viewing environment (amve) to enhance video viewing. The process involves client processing, server processing, and consumption stages. Challenges were faced in enabling Dolby Vision, but after implementing support for Dolby Vision metadata compression and decompression in FFmpeg, user engagement increased. Efforts are being made to extend Dolby Vision support to other platforms, with plans to expand it to other Meta apps and operating systems in the future. Collaboration with Dolby and FFmpeg developers has been crucial in making this possible.
