summary: "Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) is Meta's advanced network fabric technology designed for AI training networks, addressing challenges of existing networks. DSF breaks the physical limit of traditional architectures by disaggregating line and fabric cards, creating a scalable system for AI networks. DSF utilizes a VOQ-based system with a modular architecture for optimized load balancing and congestion control. It achieves near-optimal load balancing through packet spraying and credit-based congestion control. DSF has been used to build large clusters interconnecting thousands of GPUs in data center regions. The technology is evolving to create mega clusters through DSF and non-DSF region interconnectivity, exploring alternative switching technologies, and developing Hyperports to reduce the impact of fat flows on IP interconnects."
