summary: "Meta has been working on scaling its Backbone network to meet the demands of AI workloads. They have developed two networks, Classic Backbone (CBB) and Express Backbone (EBB), with EBB presenting more scalability challenges. To address these challenges, Meta has implemented techniques such as DC metro architecture, IP platform scaling, and IP/optical integration. They have also expanded their AI Backbone to support larger GPU clusters by utilizing FR, LR, and ZR plugs with Optical DWDM technology. The company plans to continue evolving and scaling its Backbone network to support future growth."
