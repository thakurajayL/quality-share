summary: "Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) is Meta's advanced network fabric technology designed for AI training networks, addressing challenges of existing networks. DSF breaks the physical limit of traditional architectures by disaggregating line and fabric cards. It is VOQ-based, using OCP-SAI standard and FBOSS, with a modular design for load balancing and congestion control. DSF enables scalable AI networks and has been used to build large clusters interconnecting thousands of GPUs. DSF's two-domain architecture separates Ethernet and fabric domains, achieving near-optimal load balancing and fine-grained traffic management. DSF has been implemented in GenAI applications, creating massive interconnected clusters. DSF's Input Balanced Mode ensures balanced traffic flow in case of link failures. Future work includes creating mega clusters across regions and developing Hyperports technology for efficient data transfer."
