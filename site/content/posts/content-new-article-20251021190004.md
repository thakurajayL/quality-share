summary: "Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) is Meta's advanced network fabric technology designed for AI training networks, addressing challenges of existing networks. DSF breaks the physical limit of traditional architectures by disaggregating components for scalability and performance. It uses a two-domain architecture with interface nodes (INs) and fabric nodes (FNs) to achieve high performance and scalability. DSF utilizes packet spraying and a credit-based congestion control algorithm for efficient traffic management. DSF has been implemented to build large clusters interconnecting thousands of GPUs within data center regions. The technology includes features like Input Balanced Mode to ensure balanced traffic flow in case of link failures. Future work includes creating mega clusters for interconnectivity between regions and developing Hyperports technology to reduce the impact of fat flows on IP interconnects."
