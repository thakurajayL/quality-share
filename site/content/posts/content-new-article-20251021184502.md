summary: "Meta has been working on scaling its Backbone network to support the increasing demands of AI workloads. They have developed new technologies and designs to address their scaling needs, particularly focusing on their Classic Backbone (CBB) and Express Backbone (EBB) networks. EBB presents more scalability challenges compared to CBB. To scale up to 10X Backbone, Meta has implemented techniques such as DC metro architecture, IP platform scaling, and IP/optical integration. They have also expanded their AI Backbone to support larger GPU clusters by identifying suitable expansion locations and utilizing different technologies based on reach requirements. The company has learned valuable lessons from scaling their network and plans to continue evolving and scaling their Backbone to meet future demands."
