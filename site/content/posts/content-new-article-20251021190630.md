summary: "Meta has scaled its Backbone network to support increasing AI workloads by developing new technologies and designs. The network consists of Classic Backbone (CBB) and Express Backbone (EBB), with EBB presenting more scalability challenges. Techniques used for scaling include DC metro architecture, IP platform scaling, and IP/optical integration. The network has evolved to support AI workloads by expanding to city-size data centers and utilizing leaf-and-spine architecture. The use of ZR technology has significantly reduced power consumption. The network has faced unexpected acceleration in scalability plans, leading to key learnings and future plans for further evolution and scaling."
