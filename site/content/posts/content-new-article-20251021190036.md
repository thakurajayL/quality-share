summary: "Meta has scaled its Backbone network to support increasing AI workloads by developing new technologies and designs. The network consists of Classic Backbone (CBB) and Express Backbone (EBB), with EBB presenting more scalability challenges. To scale to 10X Backbone, Meta used techniques such as DC metro architecture, IP platform scaling, and IP/optical integration. They also expanded the AI Backbone to support larger GPU clusters by utilizing FR, LR, and ZR plugs with Optical DWDM technology. The network evolution involved pre-building scalable metro designs, reducing active devices through IP/optical integration, and planning for city-size data centers. Future plans include implementing leaf-and-spine architecture for scalability and further developing the AI Backbone network."
