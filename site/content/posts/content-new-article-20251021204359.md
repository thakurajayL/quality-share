summary: "Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) is Meta's advanced network fabric technology designed for AI training networks, overcoming challenges of existing networks. DSF breaks the physical limits of traditional architectures by disaggregating components for scalability and performance. It uses a two-domain architecture with interface nodes (INs) and fabric nodes (FNs) to achieve high performance and scalability. DSF employs packet spraying and credit-based congestion control for efficient traffic management, ensuring near-optimal load balancing and full bandwidth utilization. DSF has been implemented in large clusters interconnecting thousands of GPUs within data center regions. The technology addresses issues like elephant flows and low entropy traffic patterns common in AI workloads. DSF also features Input Balanced Mode to maintain balanced traffic flow in case of link failures. Future work includes creating mega clusters for interconnecting GPUs across regions and developing Hyperports technology to enhance network performance."
