summary: "Meta is focusing on achieving net zero emissions by 2030 and is working on creating a common taxonomy for the industry to measure carbon emissions. They have developed a methodology that uses AI to estimate and track the carbon emissions of IT hardware components in data centers. This approach involves a combination of cost-based estimates, modeled estimates, and product carbon footprints (PCFs) to provide a detailed understanding of embodied carbon emissions. By leveraging AI, they aim to improve the accuracy and coverage of Scope 3 emission estimates for IT hardware. They are collaborating with the OCP PCR group to open source this methodology and drive the industry towards more sustainable manufacturing practices."
