summary: "Meta is sharing details at the Open Compute Project Summit about next-generation network fabrics for AI training clusters. They are expanding their network hardware portfolio and contributing new disaggregated network platforms to OCP. Meta believes open hardware is crucial for innovation in data center infrastructure supporting AI technologies. They have made significant contributions to OCP, including sharing designs and open-sourcing their network operating system, FBOSS. Meta is advancing open network technologies for AI applications, introducing new milestones for data center networking, such as Dual-Stage DSF and NSF architectures. They are also launching new OCP switch platforms and evolving FBOSS and SAI for DSF and NSF. Meta is leading the Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking initiative within OCP to advance Ethernet technology for high-performance AI systems. They invite industry partners to collaborate in shaping the future of networking hardware for AI."
