summary: "Sapling is an open-source source control system used at Meta, designed to handle branching workflows in large monorepos. It introduces directory branching as a solution to scalability challenges faced by full-repo branching. Directory branching allows for managing multiple versions of code within a monorepo by treating directories like traditional repository branches. The implementation involves operations like subtree copy, graft, and merge. User feedback on directory branching has been positive, with teams adopting it for various reasons such as managing CI costs and experimental changes. Future work includes integrating Git repositories into the monorepo using a lightweight migration mechanism. The article also acknowledges contributors and communities involved in the development of directory branching in Sapling."
