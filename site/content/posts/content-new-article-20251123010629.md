summary: Meta has released Ax 1.0, an open-source platform that uses machine learning for adaptive experimentation. It is used at scale across Meta to improve AI models, tune production infrastructure, and accelerate advances in ML and hardware design. Ax employs Bayesian optimization and provides tools for understanding and visualizing optimization progress. Users can get started with Ax by installing the library and accessing tutorials on the Ax website. The platform is continuously being improved and is open source, inviting contributions from the practitioner and research communities.
