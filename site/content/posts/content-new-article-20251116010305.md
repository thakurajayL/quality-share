summary: Meta has developed the Generative Ads Recommendation Model (GEM) to improve ad performance and advertiser ROI by enhancing ad relevance. GEM's architecture allows for efficient scaling with a large number of parameters and has shown significant increases in ad conversions on Instagram and Facebook. It is the largest foundation model for recommendation systems in the industry, trained at the scale of large language models. GEM overcomes challenges through scalable architecture, post-training techniques, and enhanced training infrastructure. Representation learning and parameter sharing are key techniques used in training the GEM model for ad click prediction. The future of ads recommendation systems will focus on personalization and understanding user intent, with GEM playing a central role.
