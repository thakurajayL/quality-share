summary: "Meta has scaled its Backbone network to support increasing AI workloads by developing new technologies and designs. The network consists of Classic Backbone (CBB) and Express Backbone (EBB), with EBB presenting more scalability challenges. Techniques used for scaling include DC metro architecture, IP platform scaling, and IP/optical integration. The network has evolved to support AI workloads by expanding to city-size data centers and utilizing advanced connectivity solutions like ZR plugs and Optical DWDM technology. The future involves implementing leaf-and-spine architecture to further scale the network."
