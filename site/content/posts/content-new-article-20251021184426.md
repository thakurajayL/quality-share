summary: "Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) is Meta's advanced network fabric technology for AI training networks, addressing challenges of existing networks. DSF breaks the physical limit of traditional architectures by disaggregating line and fabric cards. It is VOQ-based, powered by OCP-SAI standard and FBOSS, offering scalability and performance for AI networks. DSF achieves near-optimal load balancing and congestion control through packet spraying and credit-based allocation. DSF has been used to build large clusters interconnecting thousands of GPUs. The DSF architecture separates the network into Ethernet and fabric domains, enabling efficient traffic distribution. DSF is designed to handle AI workloads with large, continuous data streams and limited traffic variation. Input Balanced Mode ensures balanced traffic flow in case of link failures. Future work includes creating mega clusters with interconnectivity between regions and developing Hyperports technology to reduce the impact of fat flows on IP interconnects."
