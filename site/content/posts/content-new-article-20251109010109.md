summary: Meta uses invisible watermarking to track content provenance on their platforms, detect AI-generated videos, verify original video posters, and identify video sources and tools used. They developed a CPU-based solution for scalability, embedding imperceptible signals into media for robust content tagging. Traditional methods like visual watermarks and metadata tags are less effective. Optimization considerations include latency, watermark detection accuracy, visual quality, and compression efficiency. The team worked to ensure undetectability of the watermark through custom post-processing techniques and manual inspections. They aim to improve precision and copy-detection recall in the future for seamless integration into various video use cases with minimal impact on user experience.
