summary: "Meta has scaled its Backbone network to support increasing AI workloads by developing new technologies and designs. The network consists of Classic Backbone (CBB) and Express Backbone (EBB), with EBB presenting more scalability challenges. Techniques used to scale to 10X Backbone include DC metro architecture, IP platform scaling, and IP/optical integration. The AI Backbone has also been developed to support larger GPU clusters, with solutions for connectivity based on reach. The network has evolved over the years, with plans to build city-size data centers and implement leaf-and-spine architecture for further scalability."
