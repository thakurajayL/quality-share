It simplifies the consensus problem into leader election, log replication, and safety, ensuring safety and consistency in distributed systems. Raft handles cluster membership changes efficiently and uses a strong leadership approach to simplify the algorithm. It has been shown to be easier to learn and implement compared to Paxos, with open-source implementations used by several companies. The algorithm ensures log entries are safely replicated and committed, handles leader election, and supports safe configuration changes. Raft&amp;rsquo;s approach prioritizes understandability, correctness, and performance, making it a practical foundation for system building.</description></item><item><title>In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)</title><link>https://thakurajayL.github.io/quality-share/posts/in-search-of-an-understandable-consensus-algorithm-extended-version/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thakurajayL.github.io/quality-share/posts/in-search-of-an-understandable-consensus-algorithm-extended-version/</guid><description>Raft is a consensus algorithm developed as an alternative to Paxos, focusing on simplicity and understandability while providing equivalent results and efficiency.
