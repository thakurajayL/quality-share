The system introduces directory branching as a solution to the challenges of managing multiple versions of code in a monorepo. Directory branching allows for branching at the directory level, enabling cherry-picking and merging changes between directories while maintaining a linear commit graph at the monorepo level. This approach addresses scalability issues associated with full-repo branching and provides a flexible solution for managing code versions. The system has been well-received by engineering teams at Meta, with various use cases identified for adopting directory branching. Future plans include integrating Git repositories into the monorepo using a lightweight migration mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Branching in a Sapling Monorepo</title><link>https://thakurajayL.github.io/quality-share/posts/content-new-article-20251021190026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thakurajayL.github.io/quality-share/posts/content-new-article-20251021190026/</guid><description>Sapling is an open-source source control system used at Meta for managing a large monorepo.
