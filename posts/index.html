Directory branching allows for branching at the directory level, enabling cherry-picking and merging changes between directories while maintaining a linear commit graph at the monorepo level. This approach addresses scalability issues associated with full-repo branching and provides a flexible solution for managing code versions.

The disruption was triggered by a latent defect in the automated DNS management system of DynamoDB, causing increased API error rates. The issue was resolved by restoring DNS information. Additionally, the disruption affected Amazon EC2 instance launches, which experienced increased errors and latencies due to failures in the DropletWorkflow Manager system. Recovery involved re-establishing leases with droplets and propagating network configurations. The Network Load Balancer service also experienced connection errors due to health check failures, which were resolved by disabling automatic health check failovers.
