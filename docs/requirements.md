*`This document lists the specific, testable requirements for the project. It is the 'What' the system must do.`*

### MVP Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
*   The system shall automatically discover and process content from a list of approved external sources.
*   The system shall provide a command-line script to allow the librarian to manually trigger the curation process for a specific URL.
*   The manual add script should automatically detect the content type (e.g., blog post vs. research paper) but also provide an option to manually override the detected type.
*   All new content, whether discovered automatically or added manually, must be approved by a human librarian via a Pull Request workflow.
*   The system shall build and deploy a static website showcasing the curated content upon approval.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Transparency:** The website's footer must contain a prominent link back to the source GitHub repository.
*   **Security:** A secrets scanning tool (e.g., gitleaks) must be integrated into the GitHub Actions workflow to prevent accidental commitment of secrets.
*   **Accessibility:** The website must be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
*   **Monitoring:** The CI/CD pipeline must send an email notification upon any workflow failure.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Pagination:** Implement pagination for the homepage to improve user experience with a large number of articles.
