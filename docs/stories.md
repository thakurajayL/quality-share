## Epic 1: Project Foundation & Setup

*   **Story 1.1:** As the project owner, I want the `source-tree` directory structure created in the repository, so that we have a clean and organized codebase.
*   **Story 1.2:** As a developer, I want a new Python project initialized with Poetry in the `pipeline` directory, so that I can start developing the AI Curation Pipeline.
*   **Story 1.3:** As the project owner, I want a basic Hugo site initialized in the `site` directory, so that we have a starting point for the website.
*   **Story 1.4:** As a developer, I want a basic CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys the Hugo site to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.
*   **Story 1.5:** As a developer, I want a basic testing workflow that runs `pytest` on every Pull Request to ensure code quality.
